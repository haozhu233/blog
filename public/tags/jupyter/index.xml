      <description>When you have admin access to an AWS EC2 machine/Google Cloud or you can access the control console through either the web interface or cli, you basically just need to follow the following guides.
For AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/setup-jupyter.html
For Google Cloud: https://course.fast.ai/start_gcp.html
However, I recently came across the case that someone has already very kindly setup the computing environment for me on EC2. However, since it&amp;rsquo;s for a class project and the server is managed by the department, as you can imagine, I have neither the root access nor the access to the cloud console.</description>
