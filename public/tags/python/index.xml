      <title>Setting up Jupyter Notebook on an AWS machine without admin access</title>

      <description>When you have admin access to an AWS EC2 machine/Google Cloud or you can access the control console through either the web interface or cli, you basically just need to follow the following guides.
For AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/setup-jupyter.html
For Google Cloud: https://course.fast.ai/start_gcp.html
However, I recently came across the case that someone has already very kindly setup the computing environment for me on EC2. However, since it&amp;rsquo;s for a class project and the server is managed by the department, as you can imagine, I have neither the root access nor the access to the cloud console.</description>

      <title>Implementing Gaussian Process in Python and R</title>

      <description>library(reticulate) reticulate::use_condaenv(&amp;quot;dl&amp;quot;) knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = F, warning = F) This blog post is trying to implementing Gaussian Process (GP) in both Python and R. The main purpose is for my personal practice and hopefully it can also be a reference for future me and other people. In fact, it’s actually converted from my first homework in a Bayesian Deep Learning class.
All of the equations or figures mentioned in this post can be referened in the Rasmussen &amp;amp; Williams’ textbook for Gaussian Process.</description>
