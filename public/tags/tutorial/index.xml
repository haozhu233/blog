      <description>For now, the example below requires you to have a Mac or Linux computer. Windows support might come later.
 Sensors are fun. They are small electronic chips that can sense this world. Our smartphones have a bunch of sensors, like gyroscope and accelerometer, but you can also connect these sensors with either an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi. (In this post, I won&amp;rsquo;t talk about Raspberry Pi because although I have one Raspberry Pi at home, the only thing I did with that board so far is to get it out of box&amp;hellip; ðŸ˜³)</description>

      <description>plotly has a very nice example about how to making a streaming plot in R. When I was working on the arduino package, I need this feature because I want to create a plotting panel where data will be plotted once collected. So I used that example and quickly created a streaming app.
Here is the core part from the example
p &amp;lt;- plot_ly( y = c(rand(),rand(),rand()), type = &amp;#39;scatter&amp;#39;, mode = &amp;#39;lines&amp;#39;, line = list( color = &amp;#39;#25FEFD&amp;#39;, width = 3 ) ) %&amp;gt;% layout(yaxis = list(range = c(0,10))) output$plot &amp;lt;- renderPlotly(p) observeEvent(input$button, { while(TRUE){ Sys.</description>
